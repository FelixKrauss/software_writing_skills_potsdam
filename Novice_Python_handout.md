#Python

##Introduction

> [Python](https://www.python.org/) is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
> It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to 
> object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, 
> together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting 
> and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. <cite>[A byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/)

There are several Python tutorials available for beginners, therefore rather than creating a new tutorial we considered putting them together.

#The topics that we will cover here are:

1. How To - 'Hello World'
2. Literal Constants: integers, floats and strings
3. Variables: use them in python commands (slicing, splicing, overwriting)
4. Sets and lists: define and access list (min, max, index, sort, unique, append, reverse, combine, sum, intersect, string to list etc.)
5. File handling: create, read, write, open, close
6. If, elif and else: making choices and defining conditionals
7. For-loop: repeated tasks like reading multiple files for same action
8. Functions
9. Import packages and work with them: os, sys, numpy, matplotlib
10. Perform operations on arrays of data.
11. Display simple graphs.
12. Basic error and exceptions: Try and Except
