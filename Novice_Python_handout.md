##Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/)
"Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."-[A byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/)

There are several Python tutorials available for beginners, therefore rather than creating a new tutorial we considered putting them together.

Many more... (literally millions of videos)

The topics that we will cover here are:

How to 'Hello World'?
What is integer, float, string etc?

Show python basics on the terminal like print (string, number, combinations, tab, newlines).

Variables/tuples:
Define variables and use them in python commands. (slicing, splicing)
Overwriting a tuple.

Sets and lists:
Define set, empty list and list with items. How to access list (min, max, index, sort, unique, append, reverse,  etc.)?
Create list from string.

Mathematical calculations:
Using python for mathematical calculations (combining lists, summing elments, intersection).

File handling:
Create, read, write, open, close

For-loop:
Repeating a task
Reading multiple files

If, elif and else:
Making choices and defining conditionals.

Functions:
Define functions and work with them

Import packages and work with them:
Import python packages (os, sys, numpy, matplotlib).
Perform operations on arrays of data.
Display simple graphs.

Basic error and exceptions: Try and Except

Defensive programming: do we need this?
