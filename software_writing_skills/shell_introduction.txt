1. Introduction

UNIX is a computer operating systems (OS) and shell provides an interface to execute commands and programs in Unix. 

We can open shell terminal to work with some basic commands.

The first thing you will notice is a dollar sign. This is command prompt, issued by shell that suggests that the commands can be typed. A command followed by Enter key (or return key) allows shell to read and execute the command. We refer this as running a command (command + Enter/return key).

Run command date, to get the date and time and press Enter key:
$ date

It displays an output like this:
Wed Sep 23 10:27:19 CEST 2015

A new prompt $ is printed after a command is executed that tells us that itâ€™s ready for more commands.

Run command whoami to get ID of the current user:
$ whoami
