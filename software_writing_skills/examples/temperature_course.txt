Abstract.
The increase in global mean temperatures resulting from climate change has wide reaching consequences
for the earth’s ecosystems and other natural systems. Many studies have been devoted to evaluating the
distribution and effects of these changes. We go a step further and propose the use of the heat index, a measure
of the temperature as perceived by humans, to evaluate global changes. The heat index, which is computed from
temperature and relative humidity, is more important than temperature for the health of humans and animals.
Even in cases where the heat index does not reach dangerous levels from a health perspective, it has been shown
to be an important factor in worker productivity and thus in economic productivity.
We compute the heat index from dew point temperature and absolute temperature 2 m above ground from the
ERA-Interim reanalysis data set for the years 1979–2013. The described data set provides global heat index aggregated
to daily minima, means and maxima per day (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.841057). This paper examines
these data, as well as showing aggregations to monthly and yearly values. Furthermore, the data are spatially
aggregated to the level of countries after being weighted by population density in order to facilitate the analysis
of its impact on human health and productivity. The resulting data deliver insights into the spatiotemporal development
of near-ground heat index during the course of the past three decades. It is shown that the impact of
changing heat index is unevenly distributed through space and time, affecting some areas differently than others.
The data can serve as a basis for evaluating and understanding the evolution of heat index in the course of climate
change, as well as its impact on human health and productivity
